## Pre-amble (feel free to skip)

I started writing this article more than 4 years ago in 2022 but this article did not take 4 years to make. It was originally a two part article written for NUS High's Computer Science Interest Group, Appventure. However, due to various reasons such as scaling complexity, school work, dwindling motivation and many additional commitments, I never finished the second part.

The original blogpost can be found [here](https://nush.app/blog/2022/05/26/cnn-from-scratch-1/) (Please do not read, it is really bad). Over the last 4 years, I was pestered by my editor Prannaya to finish this but today I finally do it all. This is a full rewrite to make the original more clear and accessible. For the full story, on why it took so long refer to the addendum at the end. 

## Introduction

AI specifically those powered by neural networks have taken over. I setup this entire website with claude code and I almost write all my code for work with claude code. However despite its widespread use, very few people actually know how neural networks work and the math and logic behind them. Well, people actually do kind of have an idea on how it works but their understanding is opaque, they can explain it in general terms but they aren't able to build it themselves. Today, WE BUILD IT OURSELVES.

In this article, we build a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch with Numpy. I mean it is not exactly from scratch but it is "from scratch enough". We will start with a simple example, then we with move on to an example with a simple Feed Forward Neural Network and finally we will have a full working example with a Convolutional Neural Network.

## Scope

This article lives in a weird gray area. Neural networks are written in a very optimised way and some amount of agreement on how tensors are implemented is needed for it to actually be implemented. However, I dont want to touch tensors, because it becomes harder to visualise and I am not super familiar with tensor analysis and differential geometry (I dont know at all). The moment you find a "derivative" of a matrix with respect to another matrix, it is already a mostly empty order-4 tensor (4d matrix). A convolution layer with multiple input channels and output channels has a derivative which is an even emptier order 6 tensor.

Perhaps one day I will return to this article and  The article is intended for students who already understand Linear Algebra 1, Calculus 1 and basic Python.

## Gradient Descent Example (Linear System Solution)

First, lets import **Numpy**.

```python
>>> import numpy as np
```

Gradient Descent on a full neural network is a pretty difficult taks so let us try Gradient Descent on a simple example. Let's start with this simple two variable simultaneous equation system.

$$
\begin{aligned}
4a+2b&=22\\
3a+8b&=49
\end{aligned}
$$

We will attempt to solve this with Gradient Descent.

If you remember, Gradient Descent is a method used to solve any sort of equation by taking steps towards the real value by using calculus to predict the direction and size of the step. Essentially if you remember in calculus, the minimum of the graph will have a tangent of slope 0 and hence we can understand the direction of these "steps" to solve the problem. We just need a function where the derivative and function result approach 0 as you get closer to the true solution. This function is known as the objective function.

As you probably know, a linear equation is written as such:

$$
A \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}=0
$$

where $A$ is a known square matrix, $\mathbf{b}$ is a known vector and $\mathbf{x}$ is an unknown vector.

In this case, for the objective function we will use Linear Least Squares (LLS) function as it is an accurate thing to minimize in this case written below.

$$
F(\mathbf{x}) = {||A\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}||}_{2}^{2}
$$

### Matrix Calculus

Now, what do the weird lines and two occurences of "2" above mean and how exactly do we calculate the derivative of a scalar in terms of a vector? Well we have to learn matrix calculus, a very peculiar domain of math that is very torturous. Ideally, you want to avoid this at all cost, but I will do a gentle walk through this stuff.

Firstly, let's revise derivatives wth this simple example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y&=\sin{\left(x^2\right)}+5\\
\frac{dy}{dx}&=\frac{d}{dx}\left(\sin{\left(x^2\right)}+5\right)\\
&=2x\cos{\left(x^2\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$

For functions with multiple variables, we can find the partial derivative with respect to each of the variables, as shown below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x,y)&=3xy+x^2\\
\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}&=3y+2x\\
\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y}&=3x
\end{aligned}
$$

A thing to understand is that vectors are just a collection of numbers, so an n-sized vector will have n partial derivatives if the function is $f:\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (the derivative is known as the gradient). But do we represent these n partial derivatives as a column vector or row vector?

$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial\mathbf{x}} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{1}}\\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{2}}\\
\vdots\\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{n}}\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial\mathbf{x}} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{1}} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{2}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{n}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Well, both actually can work (even if you think of a vector as a column vector), the first version is called the denominator layout and the second one is called the numerator layout. They are both transpositions of each other. For gradient descent the denominator layout is more natural because for standard practice because we think of a vector as a column vector. I also prefer the denominator layout. However, the numerator layout follows the rules of single variable calculus more normally and will be much easier to follow. For example, matrices do not have commutative multiplication so the direction you chain terms matters. We naturally think of chaining terms to the back and this is true for numerator layout but in denominator layout terms are chained to the front. Product rule also is more funny when it comes to denom layout. So moving forward we will stick with the numerator layout and transpose the matrix or vector once the derivative is found. We will also stick to column vectors.

First lets look at the $A\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}$ term and we will see why the derivative is so and so with a simple $2 \times 2$ case. $A\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}$ is a $f:\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and hence the derivative will be a matrix (known as the Jacobian to many). Lets first, see the general equation and work it out for every value.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{y} &= A\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}\\
\begin{bmatrix}
{\mathbf{y}}_{1} \\
{\mathbf{y}}_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
{a}_{11} & {a}_{12}\\
{a}_{21} & {a}_{22}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
{\mathbf{x}}_{1} \\
{\mathbf{x}}_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
-
\begin{bmatrix}
{\mathbf{b}}_{1} \\
{\mathbf{b}}_{2}
\end{bmatrix} \\
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
{a}_{11}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{12}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1} \\
{a}_{21}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{22}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we calculate the Jacobian (remember that it is transposed) by calculating the individual derivative for every value.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} &=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{y}}_{1}}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{1}} & \frac{\partial {\mathbf{y}}_{1}}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{2}}\\
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{y}}_{2}}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{1}} & \frac{\partial {\mathbf{y}}_{2}}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{2}}\\
\end{bmatrix} \\
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{y}}_{1}}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{1}} &= {a}_{11}\\
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{y}}_{1}}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{2}} &= {a}_{12}\\
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{y}}_{2}}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{1}} &= {a}_{21}\\
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{y}}_{2}}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{2}} &= {a}_{22}\\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
{a}_{11} & {a}_{12}\\
{a}_{21} & {a}_{22}\\
\end{bmatrix}
= A
\end{aligned}
$$

We see that it is kind of the same with single variable, where if we have $f(x)=ax$, then $f'(x)=a$ where a is constant.

Now we look at the lines and "2"s. This is a common function known as the euclidean norm or 2-norm.

$$
\|{\mathbf {x}}\|_{2}:={\sqrt {x_{1}^{2}+\cdots +x_{n}^{2}}}
$$

We then square it giving rise to the second "2". Now we define and do the same thing we did with $Ax-b$, $\|{\mathbf {y}}\|_{2}^{2}$ is $f:\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Hence, the derivative is a row vector.

$$
\begin{aligned}
z&=\|{\mathbf {y}}\|_{2}^{2}\\
&={\mathbf {y}}_{1}^{2} + {\mathbf {y}}_{2}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we calculate the Gradient (remember that it is transposed) by calculating the individual derivative for every value.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial\mathbf{y}} &=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial{\mathbf{y}}_{1}} & \frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial{\mathbf{y}}_{2}}
\end{bmatrix} \\
\frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial{\mathbf{y}}_{1}} &= 2\mathbf{y}_{1} \\
\frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial{\mathbf{y}}_{2}} &= 2\mathbf{y}_{2} \\
\frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial\mathbf{y}} &=
\begin{bmatrix}
2\mathbf{y}_{1} & 2\mathbf{y}_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
= 2\mathbf{y}^{T}
\end{aligned}
$$

To illustrate the chain rule, I will calculate it individually and put it all together.

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(\mathbf{x}) &= {||A\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}||}_{2}^{2} \\
&= {({a}_{11}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{12}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1})}^{2} +
{({a}_{21}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{22}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1})}^{2} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we calculate the Final Gradient by calculating the individual derivative for every value.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial\mathbf{x}} &=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{1}} & \frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{2}}
\end{bmatrix}\\
\frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{1}} &= 2{a}_{11}({a}_{11}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{12}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1}) + 2{a}_{21}({a}_{21}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{22}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1})\\
\frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}_{2}} &= 2{a}_{12}({a}_{11}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{12}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1}) + 2{a}_{22}({a}_{21}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{22}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1})\\
\frac{\partial F(\mathbf{x})}{\partial\mathbf{x}} &=
\begin{bmatrix}
2{a}_{11}({a}_{11}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{12}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1}) + 2{a}_{21}({a}_{21}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{22}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1}) & 2{a}_{12}({a}_{11}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{12}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1}) + 2{a}_{22}({a}_{21}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{22}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1})
\end{bmatrix}\\
&= 2
\begin{bmatrix}
{a}_{11}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{12}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1} &
{a}_{21}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {a}_{22}{\mathbf{x}}_{2}-{\mathbf{b}}_{1}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
{a}_{11} & {a}_{12} \\
{a}_{21} & {a}_{22} \\
\end{bmatrix} = 2{(A\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b})}^{T}A
\end{aligned}
$$

As we can see from that last step, its pretty complex an expression, but you can see how neat matrix notation is as compared to writing all that out and you see how matrix calculus works. With numerator layout, its very similar to single-variable but with a few extra steps.

I then transpose the derivative back into the denominator layout written below. The step function is also written below which we will use for the gradient descent.

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(\mathbf{x}) &= {||A\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}||}^{2} \\
\nabla F(\mathbf {x} ) &= 2 A^{T}(A\mathbf {x} -\mathbf{b}) \\
\mathbf{x}_{n+1} &= \mathbf{x}_{n}-\gamma \nabla F(\mathbf {x} _{n})
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\gamma$ is the learning rate, we need a small learning rate as it prevents the function from taking large steps and objective functions tend to overblow the "true" error of a function. 

We can now implement this in code form for a very simple linear system written below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
w+3x+2y-z=9\\
5w+2x+y-2z=4\\
x+2y+4z=24\\
w+x-y-3z=-12
\end{aligned}
$$

This can be written as such in matrix form:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1\\
5 & 2 & 1 & -2\\
0 & 1 & 2 & 4\\
1 & 1 & -1 & -3
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
w\\
x\\
y\\
z
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
9\\
4\\
24\\
-12
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Code Implementation

#### Variables

$$
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1\\
5 & 2 & 1 & -2\\
0 & 1 & 2 & 4\\
1 & 1 & -1 & -3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

```python
>>> A = np.array([[1,3,2,-1],[5,2,1,-2],[0,1,2,4],[1,1,-1,-3]], dtype=np.float64)
>>> A
array([[ 1.,  3.,  2., -1.],
       [ 5.,  2.,  1., -2.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  2.,  4.],
       [ 1.,  1., -1., -3.]])
```

$$
\mathbf{b}=
\begin{bmatrix}
9\\
4\\
24\\
-12
\end{bmatrix}
$$

```python
>>> b = np.array([[9],[4],[24],[-12]], dtype=np.float64) 
>>> b
array([[  9.],
       [  4.],
       [ 24.],
       [-12.]])
```

$$
\mathbf{x}=
\begin{bmatrix}
w\\
x\\
y\\
z
\end{bmatrix}
$$

```python
>>> x = np.random.rand(4,1)
>>> x
array([[0.09257854],
       [0.16847643],
       [0.39120624],
       [0.78484474]])
```

#### The Objective Function and its Derivative

$$
F(\mathbf{x}) = {||A\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}||}^{2}
$$

```python
>>> def objective_function(x):
        return np.linalg.norm(np.matmul(A,x) - b) ** 2
```

$$
\nabla F(\mathbf {x} )=2A^{T}(A\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {b})
$$

```python
>>> def objective_function_derivative(x):
        return 2 * np.matmul(A.T, np.matmul(A,x) - b)
```

In this case, I implemented an arbritary learning rate and arbritary step count. In traditional non-machine learning gradient descent, the learning rate changes per step and is determined via a heuristic such as the Barzilai–Borwein method, however this is not necessary as gradient descent is very robust. I used an arbritary step count for simplicity but you should ideally use some sort of boolean condition to break the loop such as $F(\mathbf{x})<0.01$.

$$
\mathbf {x}_{n+1}=\mathbf {x}_{n}-\gamma \nabla F(\mathbf {x} _{n})
$$

```python
>>> learning_rate = 0.01
>>> for i in range(5000):
        x -= learning_rate * objective_function_derivative(x)
>>> x
array([[1.],
       [2.],
       [3.],
       [4.]])
```

And to check, we now use a simple matrix multiplication:

```python
>>> np.matmul(A,x)
array([[  9.],
       [  4.],
       [ 24.],
       [-12.]])
```

Voila, we have solved the equation with gradient descent, and the solution is super close. This shows the power of gradient descent.

## Deep Neural Network Layer

To understand the math behind a deep neural network layer, we will first look at the single perceptron case.

![single perceptron example](./images/single_perceptron_example.png)

$$
z=xw+b\\
a=\sigma (z)
$$

where $w$ is the weight, $b$ is the bias, $x$ is the input, $\sigma$ is the activation function and $a$ is the output.

We assume that this is a single layer network and that the loss function is just applied after, and we will just use the MSE loss.

$$c = {(a-y)}^2$$

where $y$ is the true y, $c$ is the cost.

In this case, it is quite easy to represent. Let us expand it to a layer with 4 input neurons and 4 output neurons.

![multiple perceptron example](./images/multiple_perceptron_example.png)

$$
\begin{aligned}
{w}_{11}{x}_{1} + {w}_{21}{x}_{2} + {w}_{31}{x}_{3} + {w}_{41}{x}_{4} + {b}_{1} = &{z}_{1}\\
{w}_{12}{x}_{1} + {w}_{22}{x}_{2} + {w}_{32}{x}_{3} + {w}_{42}{x}_{4} + {b}_{2} = &{z}_{2}\\
{w}_{13}{x}_{1} + {w}_{23}{x}_{2} + {w}_{33}{x}_{3} + {w}_{43}{x}_{4} + {b}_{3} = &{z}_{3}\\
{w}_{14}{x}_{1} + {w}_{24}{x}_{2} + {w}_{34}{x}_{3} + {w}_{44}{x}_{4} + {b}_{4} = &{z}_{4}\\
{a}_{1}=\sigma(&{z}_{1})\\
{a}_{2}=\sigma(&{z}_{2})\\
{a}_{3}=\sigma(&{z}_{3})\\
{a}_{4}=\sigma(&{z}_{4})\\
c = \frac{1}{4} \left((a_1-y_1)^2 + (a_2 - y_2)^2 + (a_3 - y_3)^2 + (a_4 - y_4)^2\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

As you can see, this is just a linear system much like the one showed in the example and it becomes very simple.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{z} &= W\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}\\
\mathbf{a} &= \sigma(\mathbf{z}) \\
c &= \frac{1}{n} ||\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{y}||^2_2
\end{aligned}
$$

From our work earlier we know that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{b}}&=I \\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}&= W \\
\frac{\partial c}{\partial \mathbf{a}} &= \frac{2}{n} \left(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{y} \right)^\text{T}
\end{aligned}
$$

However we have once again hit a speedbump. How do we find the derivative of a vector $\mathbf{z}$ with respect to a matrix $W$? The function is of the form $f:\mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$. Hence, the derivative will be a third order tensor also known as a 3D matrix. (colloquially) But for now we will use a trick to dodge the usage of third order tensors because of the nature of the function $W\mathbf{x}$. For this example, I use $m=3$ and $n=2$ but its generalizable for any sizes.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{z} = W\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}\\
\begin{bmatrix}
{\mathbf{z}}_{1} \\
{\mathbf{z}}_{2} \\
{\mathbf{z}}_{3}
\end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
{w}_{11} & {w}_{12}\\
{w}_{21} & {w}_{22}\\
{w}_{31} & {w}_{32}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
{\mathbf{x}}_{1} \\
{\mathbf{x}}_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
{\mathbf{b}}_{1} \\
{\mathbf{b}}_{2} \\
{\mathbf{b}}_{3}
\end{bmatrix} \\
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
{w}_{11}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {w}_{12}{\mathbf{x}}_{2} - {\mathbf{b}}_{1}\\
{w}_{21}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {w}_{22}{\mathbf{x}}_{2} - {\mathbf{b}}_{1}\\
{w}_{31}{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + {w}_{32}{\mathbf{x}}_{2} - {\mathbf{b}}_{1}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

We now calculate the individual derivatives of $\mathbf{z}$ wrt to $W$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{1}}{\partial w_{11}}=\mathbf{x}_{1}\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{2}}{\partial w_{11}}=0\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{3}}{\partial w_{11}}=0\\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{1}}{\partial w_{12}}=\mathbf{x}_{2}\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{2}}{\partial w_{12}}=0\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{3}}{\partial w_{12}}=0\\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{1}}{\partial w_{21}}=0\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{2}}{\partial w_{21}}=\mathbf{x}_{1}\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{3}}{\partial w_{21}}=0\\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{1}}{\partial w_{22}}=0\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{2}}{\partial w_{22}}=\mathbf{x}_{2}\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{3}}{\partial w_{22}}=0\\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{1}}{\partial w_{31}}=0\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{2}}{\partial w_{31}}=0\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{3}}{\partial w_{31}}=\mathbf{x}_{1}\\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{1}}{\partial w_{32}}=0\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{2}}{\partial w_{32}}=0\quad
\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{3}}{\partial w_{32}}=\mathbf{x}_{2}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

We see that this is a pretty complex looking tensor but we see that a majority of the values are 0 allowing us to pull of an epic hack by considering the fact that at the end we are essentially trying to get a singular scalar value (the loss) and find the partial derivative of that wrt to $W$. There are some steps involved in getting from $\mathbf{z}$ to $c$ but for simplicity instead of showing everything, we will condense all of this into a function $f:\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which is defined as $c=f(\mathbf{z})$. In this case, we know the tensor values and we know the gradient and what the derivative should be. Hence, we now just evaluate it and see if we can see any property:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial\mathbf{z}} &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}}
\end{bmatrix} \\
\frac{\partial c}{\partial W} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial{w}_{11}} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{w}_{21}} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{w}_{31}}\\
\frac{\partial c}{\partial{w}_{12}} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{w}_{22}} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{w}_{32}}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{\partial c}{\partial \mathbf{z}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{W}}
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}}\frac{\partial {\mathbf{z}}_{1}}{\partial{w}_{11}} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}}\frac{\partial {\mathbf{z}}_{2}}{\partial{w}_{21}} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{3}}\frac{\partial {\mathbf{z}}_{3}}{\partial{w}_{31}}\\
\frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}}\frac{\partial {\mathbf{z}}_{1}}{\partial{w}_{12}} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}}\frac{\partial {\mathbf{z}}_{2}}{\partial{w}_{22}} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{3}}\frac{\partial {\mathbf{z}}_{3}}{\partial{w}_{32}}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}}\mathbf{x}_{1} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}}\mathbf{x}_{1} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{3}}\mathbf{x}_{1}\\
\frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}}\mathbf{x}_{2} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}}\mathbf{x}_{2} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{3}}\mathbf{x}_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\mathbf{x}\frac{\partial c}{\partial\mathbf{z}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Wonderful, we have just found out this amazing method, where we just add $\mathbf{x}$ to the front. Normally this method is not possible but it is just possible in this special case as we dont have to consider terms such as $\frac{\partial c}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}}\frac{\partial {\mathbf{z}}_{2}}{\partial{w}_{11}}$ because they are just 0. It helps us dodge all the possibilites of tensor calculus (at least for now) and allows the NumPy multiplication to be much easier. $f$ can also generalize for any vector to scalar function, not just the specific steps we make.

The next speedbump is much more easier to grasp than the last one, and that is element-wise operations. In this case, we have the activation function $\sigma:\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ or $\sigma:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which looks like a sigmoid function, but this is just a placeholder function. It can be any $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ activation function, such as $\text{RELU}(x) = \text{max}(x, 0)$, or whatever else has been found in research, such as SMELU and GELU. Once again, we work it out for every single value, as shown below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{a} &= \sigma(\mathbf{z})\\
\begin{bmatrix}
{\mathbf{a}}_{1} \\
{\mathbf{a}}_{2} \\
{\mathbf{a}}_{3}
\end{bmatrix}
&=
\sigma\left(
\begin{bmatrix}
{\mathbf{z}}_{1} \\
{\mathbf{z}}_{2} \\
{\mathbf{z}}_{3}
\end{bmatrix}\right)
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma({\mathbf{z}}_{1}) \\
\sigma({\mathbf{z}}_{2}) \\
\sigma({\mathbf{z}}_{3})
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now for the 48th billion time, we calculate the Jacobian by calculating every individual derivative to get the general property of the operation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}}{\partial \mathbf{z}} &=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{1}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}} & \frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{1}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}}& \frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{1}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{3}}\\
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{2}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}} & \frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{2}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}} & \frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{2}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{3}}\\
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{3}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}} & \frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{3}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}} & \frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{3}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{3}}
\end{bmatrix}\\
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{1}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}}=\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}_{1})\quad
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{1}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}}&=0\quad
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{1}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{3}}=0\\
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{2}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}}=0\quad
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{2}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}}&=\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}_{2})\quad
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{2}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{3}}=0\\
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{3}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{1}}=0\quad
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{3}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{2}}&=0\quad
\frac{\partial {\mathbf{a}}_{3}}{\partial{\mathbf{z}}_{3}}=\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}_{3})\\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}}{\partial \mathbf{z}} &=
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}_{1}) & 0 & 0\\
0 & \sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}_{2}) & 0\\
0 & 0 & \sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}_{3})\\
\end{bmatrix}
=diag(\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}))
\end{aligned}
$$

As you see, we can reduce this derivative to this specific value. I have used the $diag$ operator which converts a vector to a diagonal matrix. Finally, after all this derivation (mathematically and figuratively) we can use chain rule to join everything together:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial \mathbf{b}}=\frac{\partial c}{\partial \mathbf{a}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}}{\partial \mathbf{z}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{b}}
&=
\frac{2}{n}{(\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{y})}^{T}diag(\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}))\\
\frac{\partial c}{\partial \mathbf{x}}=\frac{\partial c}{\partial \mathbf{a}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}}{\partial \mathbf{z}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}
&=
\frac{2}{n}{(\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{y})}^{T}diag(\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}))W\\
\frac{\partial c}{\partial W}=\frac{\partial c}{\partial \mathbf{a}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}}{\partial \mathbf{z}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial W}
&=
\frac{2}{n}\mathbf{x}{(\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{y})}^{T}diag(\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}))
\end{aligned}
$$

Now that we got these simple definitions for the single-layer case, we can expand it to the multi-layer case.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{a}_{0}&=\mathbf{x}\\
\mathbf{z}_{i}&={W}_{i-1}{\mathbf{a}}_{i-1} + \mathbf{b}_{i-1}\\
\mathbf{a}_{i}&=\sigma(\mathbf{z}_{i})\\
i &= 1,2,3,...,L\\
c&=\frac{1}{n}\|{\mathbf{a}-\mathbf {y}}\|_{2}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can do the calculus for the $i$-th layer now, specifically for bias and weight using the chain rule.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial \mathbf{b}_{i-1}}=\frac{\partial c}{\partial \mathbf{a}_{L}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}_L}{\partial \mathbf{z}_{L}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{L}}{\partial \mathbf{a}_{L-1}}\cdots\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}_{i}}{\partial \mathbf{z}_{i}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{i}}{\partial \mathbf{b}_{i-1}}&=
\frac{2}{n}{(\mathbf{a}_L-\mathbf{y})}^{T}diag(\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}_L))W_{L-1}\cdots diag(\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}_i))\\
\frac{\partial c}{\partial W_{i-1}}=\frac{\partial c}{\partial \mathbf{a}_{L}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}_L}{\partial \mathbf{z}_{L}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{L}}{\partial \mathbf{a}_{L-1}}\cdots\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}_{i}}{\partial \mathbf{z}_{i}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}_{i}}{\partial W_{i-1}}&=
\frac{2}{n}\mathbf{a}_{i-1}{(\mathbf{a}_L-\mathbf{y})}^{T}diag(\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}_L))W_{L-1}\cdots diag(\sigma^{'}(\mathbf{z}_i))\\
i &= 1,2,3,...,L
\end{aligned}
$$

Now it is time to actually implement this network (finally).

## Neural Network Implementation (XNOR Gate)

I couldn't find a good, but rather small dataset because most people really do like large datasets and are infuriated when they are not provided that like ~~entitled brats~~ normal people. So, instead, I decided that we will train our neural network to mimic the XNOR gate.

Oh no! Training? Testing? What is that? In all fairness, I am simply trying to show you that the mathematical functions that dictate neural networks as we have found above, fits perfectly with this task of a neural network, and that these neural networks that everyone hears about can really just mimic any function.

![XNOR input output](./images/XNOR_input_output.png)

For those who do not know, the XNOR gates inputs and outputs are written above. It is pretty suitable for this example, because the inputs and outputs are all 0 and 1, hence it is fast to train and there is no bias in the data.

From here, let's try coding out the (x,y) pairs in NumPy:

```python
data = [[np.array([[0],[0]], dtype=np.float64),np.array([[1]], dtype=np.float64)],
        [np.array([[0],[1]], dtype=np.float64),np.array([[0]], dtype=np.float64)],
        [np.array([[1],[0]], dtype=np.float64),np.array([[0]], dtype=np.float64)],
        [np.array([[1],[1]], dtype=np.float64),np.array([[1]], dtype=np.float64)]]
```

We then define a network structure. It doesn't have to be too complex because it is a pretty simple function. I decided on a $2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1$ multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure, with the sigmoid activation function.

![multiple perceptron network](./images/multiple_perceptron_network.png)

Next, let's try coding out our mathematical work based off the following class:

```python
class NNdata:
    def __init__(self):
        self.a_0 = None
        self.W_0 = np.random.rand(3,2)
        self.b_0 = np.random.rand(3,1)
        self.z_1 = None
        self.a_1 = None
        self.W_1 = np.random.rand(1,3)
        self.b_1 = np.random.rand(1,1)
        self.z_2 = None
        self.a_2 = None
        self.db_1 = None
        self.dw_1 = None
        self.db_0 = None
        self.dw_0 = None

    def sigmoid(self, x):
        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

    def sigmoid_derivative(self, x):
        return self.sigmoid(x) * (1 - self.sigmoid(x))

    def feed_forward(self, x):
        self.a_0 = x

        self.z_1 = np.matmul(self.W_0, self.a_0)+self.b_0
        self.a_1 = self.sigmoid(self.z_1)

        self.z_2 = np.matmul(self.W_1, self.a_1)+self.b_1
        self.a_2 = self.sigmoid(self.z_2)
        return self.a_2

    def loss(self, y):
        return np.linalg.norm(self.a_2-y)**2

    def back_prop(self, y):
        dcdz_2 = 2 * np.matmul((self.a_2-y).T,np.diag(self.sigmoid_derivative(self.z_2).reshape(1)))
        dcdb_1 = dcdz_2
        dcdw_1 = np.matmul(self.a_1, dcdz_2)

        dcda_1 = np.matmul(dcdz_2, self.W_1)
        dcdz_1 = np.matmul(dcda_1, np.diag(self.sigmoid_derivative(self.z_1).reshape(3)))
        dcdb_0 = dcdz_1
        dcdw_0 = np.matmul(self.a_0, dcdz_1)

        self.db_1 = dcdb_1.T
        self.dw_1 = dcdw_1.T
        self.db_0 = dcdb_0.T
        self.dw_0 = dcdw_0.T
```

Next I program gradient descent. There are 3 kinds of gradient descent when there are multiple datapoints, Stochastic, Batch and Mini-Batch. In Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the weights are updated after a single sample is run. This will obviously cause your step towards the ideal value be very chaotic. In Batch Gradient Descent, the weights are updated after every sample is run, and the net step is the sum/average of all the $\nabla F(x)$, which is less chaotic, but steps are less frequent.

Of course, in real life, we can never know which algorithm is better without making an assumption about the data. (No Free Lunch Theorem) A good compromise is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, which is like Batch Gradient Descent but use smaller chunks of all the datapoints every step. In this case, I use Batch Gradient Descent.

```python
nndata = NNdata()
learning_rate = 0.1
for i in range(10000):
    db_1_batch = []
    dw_1_batch = []
    db_0_batch = []
    dw_0_batch = []
    c = []
    for j in range(4):
        nndata.feed_forward(data[j][0])
        c.append(nndata.loss(data[j][1]))
        nndata.back_prop(data[j][1])
        db_1_batch.append(nndata.db_1)
        dw_1_batch.append(nndata.dw_1)
        db_0_batch.append(nndata.db_0)
        dw_0_batch.append(nndata.dw_0)
    if((i+1) % 1000 == 0):
        print("loss (%d/10000): %.3f" % (i+1, sum(c)/4))
    nndata.b_1 -= learning_rate * sum(db_1_batch)
    nndata.W_1 -= learning_rate * sum(dw_1_batch)
    nndata.b_0 -= learning_rate * sum(db_0_batch)
    nndata.W_0 -= learning_rate * sum(dw_0_batch)
```

Output resource:

```
loss (1000/10000): 0.245
loss (2000/10000): 0.186
loss (3000/10000): 0.029
loss (4000/10000): 0.007
loss (5000/10000): 0.003
loss (6000/10000): 0.002
loss (7000/10000): 0.002
loss (8000/10000): 0.001
loss (9000/10000): 0.001
loss (10000/10000): 0.001
```

Voila! We have officially programmed Neural Networks from scratch. Pat yourself on the back for reading through this. And of course, if you bothered to code this out, try porting it over to different languages like Java, JS or even C (yikes why would [anyone](https://github.com/terminalai/neuralC) subjects themselves to that?).

In the next part, it is time for the actual hard part. Good luck!

## References

A lot of people think I just collated a bunch of sources and rephrased, and honestly I walked into writing this thinking I would be doing just that. The problem is that many sources who have attempted to do this, only cover the single to multi-perceptron layer case and not the multi to multi-perceptron case. Which is pretty sad. The true math is hidden behind mountains of research papers that loosely connect to give the results of this blogpot which I am too incomponent to connect by myself. So, I just did the math myself. (The math may not be presented in this way but it works so it should be correct) Yes, it was a bit crazy, and it destroyed me to my core. This was a great character building moment for me.
